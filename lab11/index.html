                <h2>About</h2>
                 <p> This lab is about Working with a partner and experimenting with Jquery and other libraries.
                    We made buttons that changed the colors of different sections, as well as a single button that changed the color of all the buttons! This lab was a lot of fun to create! </p>
                 </div>

                  <div id="challenges" class="sectionbox">
                <h2>challenges</h2>
                <p> This lab was simple to complete and we finished it quickly. The difficult part was figuring out Task X, which required us to create a new button to change the color of all the other.
                   after some trial and error, we finally completed Task X with little help of stack flow!</p>
