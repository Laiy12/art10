                <h2>About</h2>
                 <p>This lab focuses on collaborating with a partner and understanding Loops!  </p>

                <h2>challenges</h2>
                <p> Overall, coming up with the code for the loops was very simple because it was also discussed in class, but the most difficult part for us was figuring out how to make it so that the output of your program appears in your output div,
                  but after some experimentation, we were able to add the given code in place and make it work! </p>
