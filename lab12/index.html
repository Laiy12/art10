                <h2>About</h2>
                 <p> This lab focuses on collaborating with a partner and understanding conditional. </p>

                <h2>challenges</h2>
                <p> This lab was a lot of fun to complete;
                  I loved typing in names and watching it assign houses to people based on it! This lab was quite easy for me to complete because the majority of the material was addressed in the lecture. </p>
