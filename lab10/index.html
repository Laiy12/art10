			<h1> Lab 9: JavaScript for the web</h1>
			<p> The goal of this lab was to learn about HTML DOM and how to use JavaScript to add and modify new elements to our pages. </p>

			<h2> Challenges </h2>
			<p>This lab seemed to be a little difficult at first, and I was unsure how to create a new HTML attribute of
			"new1El," but I referred back to the lecture slides and was able to complete the lab successfully. </p>

				 <h2> Task X </h2>
				 <p> 1.  For this assignment, we used "appendChild," which adds elements to the bottom of an element.
					 I experimented a bit more and used "outputEl.insertBefore" to print a new element on top of the existing element. </P>

			<h2> Results </h2>
			<p> See the results below !</p>
