            <h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>

            <p> The goal of the lab was to work with a partner and experiment with JavaScript events and forms.</p>

						<h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p> This lab was a little difficult to understand at first but after some help from the lectures and some reserch, we got the hang of it! </p>

						<h2>Task X</h2>
						<p> With the help of "stack overflow," we were able to determine an output for task x #3. When we pushed the "click me" button, it was able to print  a glitched text that we inputed in js!</p> 

					  <h2>Results</h2>
            <p> Type in a word and click the button to the the result below !</p>
