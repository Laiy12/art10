                <h2>About</h2>
                 <p>This lab is about checking that all previous experiments operate and how to debug using developer tools!</p>

                <h2>challenges</h2>
                <p> This lab would be easy for me to complete! All of my labs are working as well.</p>


          <h2>Task X</h2>
                 <p>To construct the breakpoints, I experimented in debugging. I launched the debugger with control, shift i, and then opened my Javascript file . Then I inserted the breakpoint, which the blue arrow allows me to halt executing and analyze the JavaScript logic in my code. As you can see in the image, i was = 3 and the logic was that because it is divisible by 3, it should print inside the logic bracket, which it did, which is how I know the code works!  In this same manner, you can run through all the numbers assigned to check if it's working </p>
