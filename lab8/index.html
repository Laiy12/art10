			<h1> Lab 8: Anon Functions and callbacks</h1>
			<p> The main goal of this lab was to work with the partner and familiarize ourselves 
				with Anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

			<h2> Challenges </h2>
			<p> This lab was rather simple to do because we had already covered the majority of the material in class. First,
				We decided to use subtraction as our function, but we decided that using one parameter instead of two would be easier,
				 so we chose to do the square root function instead! </p>

				 <h2> Task X </h2>
				 <p> 2. one call back method we implemented on our page is using "setTimeout(function())" in front of the console log.
					 I set it to 5 seconds so that it delays the display of the array map's results.</P>

			<h2> Results </h2>
			<p> To see the outputs, open the console! </p>
